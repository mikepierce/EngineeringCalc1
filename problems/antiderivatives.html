        For each of the following functions, 
        write down the formula for 
        <em>an</em> antiderivative of that function.
        Note you can always check your antiderivative 
        by taking its derivative,
        which you can in-turn check with
        <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a>.

        We denote the \(n^\text{th}\) derivative 
        of a function \(f\) as \(f^{(n)}.\)
        For example, \(f^{(13)}(x)\) is the thirteenth derivative of \(f,\)
        and is better notation than \(f'''''''''''''(x)\) 
        for the thirteenth derivative

        Given \({f^{(5)}(x) = 12x+1}\)

        Calculate the value of this sum for \(M=3\), and for \(M=7.\)

        A cyclist is wearing a heart rate monitor 
        while competing in a \(50\) mile bike race.
        They check the monitor, which tracks 
        their heart rate measured in beats-per-minute (bpm), 
        irregularly throughout the race.
        <figure>
        <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr> 
                <th>Heart Rate</th> 
                <td>66</td>  
                <td>73</td>

        First, briskly sketch a scatter plot of this data
        with your independent variable \(x\) 
        measured in minutes since the beginning of the race.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Estimating, 
                how many times did their heart beat 
                in those first \(10\) minutes of the race?
                What about the first \(33\) minutes of the race?
                What about the first \(60\) minutes of the race?
            </li>
            <li>
                Assume that, for the period between any two times 
                that the cyclist checks their heart rate,
                their heart rate is between 
                the rates the monitor reports.
                (E.g. between minutes \(58\) and \(70,\)
                their heart rate stays between \(88\) bpm and \(97\) bpm.)
                Under this assumption, can you come up with 
                an upper-bound for the number of times
                their heart beat during the race?
                I.e. can you find a number \(M\) 
                and say for certain their heart beat 
                no more than \(M\) times during the race?
                What about a lower-bound?
            </li>
            <li>
                Now let’s assume something stronger:
                assume that, for the period between any two times 
                that the cyclist checks their heart rate,
                their heart rate can be accurately described 
                by a linear function of time.
                (E.g. for any \(t\) between minutes \(58\) and \(70,\)
                their heart rate is given by the expression
                \(\frac{9}{12}(t-58)+58.\))
                Now since we are assuming we know their heart rate
                at any time throughout the race,
                we should be able to determine a exact number
                for the number of times their heart beat.
                How do we determine this number?

<h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p>
        Recall the classic proof that 
        \( 1+2+3+4+\dotsb+n = \frac{1}{2}n(n+1)\,. \)
        </p>
        <p>
        Using a similar “number arrangement” argument, prove that
        \[ 1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+\dotsb+n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\,. \]
        </p>
        <p>
        Hint: Recall that \(n^2\) is the area 
        of an \({n \times n}\) square.
        Your “number arrangement” might need more dimensions
        than the other example. 
        It also might be helpful to know that a cube
        can be decomposed into three square-based pyramids. 
        … there are multiple ways to prove this,
        so don’t think that you <em>need</em> 
        to use all/any of these facts.
