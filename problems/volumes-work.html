        Consider the region enclosed by the curves
        \(y=x^2\) and \(y=x^3\).
        <ol>
            <li> 
                Consider the solid generated by revolving
                this region about the \(y\)-axis.
                First make a sketch this solid. 
                Like, really, make it look good.
                Then write two different integrals,
                one with respect to \(x\) and the other with respect to \(y\),
                that represent the volume of this solid.
                Calculate the values of these integrals
                to verify their values are the same.
            </li> 
            <li> 
                Do the same thing, 
                but this time considering the solid generated
                by revolving the region about the \(x\)-axis instead.
                Before doing any calculations, 
                anticipate whether this volume will be larger or smaller
                than the previous volume.
            </li> 
            <li> 
                Now suppose the region is the base of a solid
                whose cross-sections parallel to the \(y\)-axis
                are all equilateral triangles,
                the hypotenuses of which lie in the region.
                First make a sketch this solid,
                Then calculate the volume of this solid.
                Protip: sketch the base region “flat”, foreshortened on your paper,
                then sketch the solid “above” it.

        Consider a single instance of one of the regions
        bound between the curves \({y = \sin(x)}\) and \({y = \cos(x).}\)

        by revolving this region about the line \(y = 2?\)

                lies directly over the center of its base.
                <!--
                How would the volume change if the cone’s “point” 
                wasn’t directly over the center of the base?

                and whose cross section perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis

        A <em>clepsydra</em>, or water clock, 
        is a glass container with a small hole in the bottom 
        through which water can flow. The “clock” is calibrated 
        for measuring time by placing markings on the container
        corresponding to water levels at equally spaced times. 
        Let \(x = f(y)\) be continuous on the interval
        \([0, b]\) and assume that the container is formed 
        by rotating the graph of \(f\) about the \(y\)-axis. 
        Let \(V\) denote the volume of water and \(h\) 
        the height of the water level at time \(f\).

            Suppose that \(A\) is the area of the hole 
            in the bottom of the container. 
            It follows from Torricelli’s Law that the rate of change 
            of the volume of the water is given by
            \( \dot{V} = kA \sqrt{h} \)
            where \(k\) is a negative constant. 
            Determine a formula for the function \(f\) 
            such that \(\dot{h}\) is a constant \(C\).
