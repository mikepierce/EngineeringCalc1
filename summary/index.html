<p>
Sometimes the purpose of taking a course 
becomes obfuscated over its duration;
it can become hard to appreciate the plot of a story 
when there’s too much exposition.
This narrative overview, in its brevity, 
serves to summarize the plot of this course
and to clarify our purpose,
for the sake of keeping both student and instructor 
focused on what’s important.
</p>
<section>
<h2>Limits &amp; Continuity</h2>
<p>
In the beginning of the story of calculus
there are some minor characters we must meet.
These characters’ primary importance is to 
introduce us to the protagonists of calculus,
differentiation and the integration,
but we should know them in their own right first.
The first of these minor characters 
is the limit.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Understand what the notation
        \( \lim\limits_{x \to x_0} f(x) \) means.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to compute
        \( \lim\limits_{x \to x_0} f(x) \)
        either numerically or precisely.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
The important idea behind introducing the limit 
is that we need language and notation
for talking what what’s happening <em>around</em> a point \(x_0\), 
instead of directly at the point.
While discussing the purpose of the course,
we’ll gradually reveal the limit’s relationship to the derivative
and how it can help us find the slope
of a line tangent to a curve at a given point.
</p>
<p>
The other of minor character
is the concept of <em>continuity</em> of a function.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Understand what it means for a function
        to be continuous on some domain,
        and why many natural phenomenon morally
        <em>should</em> be modelled a continuous function.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
We can only apply the techniques of calculus,
define the derivative and integral of a function 
on some domain as a formula,
if we take the hypothesis that the function 
is continuous on that domain.
</p>
<p>
One last thing: 
I hope you all feel free and comfortable coming to talk to me, 
either about mathematics or about this class in general. 
If there is anything I can do 
to make communication feel more comfortable, 
please let me know. 
Education is generally more beneficial 
when treated more like a conversation 
between student and teacher rather than a

</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Differentiation</h2>
<p>
Since learning the language of limits
and the idea of continuity of functions,
we now have all we need to define the <em>derivative</em> of a function
and will immediately discuss two important things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Know and understand the definition of the derivative of a function, 
        \[
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f(x) 
        = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\,,
        \]
        and how you can think of this derivative 
        as a rate of change of the function output 
        relative to the function input, 
        <em>or</em> how you can think of it geometrically 
        as a slope of a tangent line.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to write a formula for the derivative of any function 
        expressed in terms of rational functions, trigonometric functions, 
        or power functions (e.g. square roots, etc).  
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
The former of these is a concept you must internalize 
as you work through exercises, reading examples, 
and generally reading about calculus. 
(You do read, right? If not the textbook, 
then any helpful notes or pages online.)
The latter is a skill you can practice until you feel proficient, 
and luckily 
<a title="Google Image search of derivative exercises" href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=derivative%20exercises&tbs=imgo:1">such exercises are plentiful online</a>. 
Sometimes those exercises are accompanied by solutions, 
but if they’re not
<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/derivative-calculator/">Wolfram|Alpha can compute derivatives for you</a>.
A word of caution though: 
the expectation is that <em>you</em> can compute derivatives. 
Let Wolfram|Alpha be your aid, not your crutch—hopefully 
similar to the relationship you have with your calculator.
</p>
<p>
Once you are comfortable taking derivatives of functions \(y = f(x)\) 
where the effect the independent variable \(x\), 
the variable you’re differentiating with respect to,
has on a dependent variable \(y\) is made <q>explicit</q>
you’ll need to extend this skill,
applying it to equations where the relationship between \(x\) 
and any independent variables is only <q>implicit</q>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to implicitly differentiate any equation 
        involving rational expressions, trigonometric expressions, 
        or power terms (e.g. square roots, etc).  
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Just like with explicit differentiation, 
there are plenty of exercises and worked-out examples online,
and you can compare your computations with 
<a title="Wolfram|Alpha implicit differentiation example" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=implicit+differentiation+for+ye%5Ex%3Dx-y">Wolfram|Alpha’s</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In class we’ll spend time thinking about the graphs of functions,
and what more we can say about those graphs
given our new knowledge of derivatives.
This isn’t an important skill we’re learning though.
The purpose of doing this is to buff your 
understanding of the concept of a derivative,
and give you a visual perspective on the relationship
between a function and its derivative.
</p>
<p>
Beyond this, there are three important 
uses of differentiation we’ll talk about.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to apply your differentiation skills
        to analyze <em>dynamic</em> situations, 
        i.e. situations that aren’t static, that are changing over time.
        The ubiquitous class of problems 
        that require this ability to solve are called
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Related Rates" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/relatedrates.aspx">related rates problems</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to apply your differentiation skills
        to optimize some quantity,
        minimize or maximize some function,
        relative to some changing parameters.
        The ubiquitous class of problems 
        that require this ability to solve are called
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Optimization" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/optimization.aspx">optimization problems</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first of these will require you 
to be adept at implicit differentiation.
The second will simply be an extension of a skill that (I hope!) 
you’ve already practiced before in math class.
Both of these will require that you be comfortable
synthesizing mathematical equations and relationships
from a concrete situation.
And luckily both of these topics are well documented on the internet;
you way want to append the phrases <q>calculus 1</q> or <q>single variable</q>
to your search phrases though.
</p>
<p>
There is one last numerical/computational application
of differentiation we’ll discuss.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Perform
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Newton’s Method" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/newtonsmethod.aspx">Newton’s method</a> 
        manually, and understand that lines are very useful.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
It’s more important that you understand the <em>idea</em>
behind Newton’s method rather than be proficient at working it out manually;
the goal here is <em>familiarity</em>, not <em>fluency</em>,
so that one day you could implement it with a computer if you need to.
If you’re practicing computer programming while taking this class though,
you might as well implement it now.
</p>
<p>
In the next segment of class we’ll explore 
differentiation’s dual operation: integration.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Integration Basics</h2>
<p>
Now that we know basically everything about differentiation,
it’s time to turn our attention to the other side 
of the story of calculus: integration.
First we’ll surmount two conceptual hurdles,
understanding what integration <em>is</em>
and how it relates to differentiation.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Understand that the definite integral 
        \(\int_a^b f(t) \;\mathrm{d}t\) 
        has a <q>physical</q> interpretation 
        as the total amount of <em>something</em>
        that \(f\) has accumulated 
        as its input moves from \(a\) to \(b\),
        but also a geometric interpretation as
        the signed area of the region bound by
        the graph of \(y=f(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis
        between \(a\) and \(b\).
        Furthermore understand what the function
        \(\int_0^t f\) represents.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Have a <em>working</em> understanding of 
        the fundamental theorem of calculus,
        knowing abstractly that differentiation 
        and integration are <q>inverse</q> operations,
        and knowing concretely that
        \[
            \newcommand{\ddt}{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}}
            \ddt \int\limits_a^t f = f(t)
            \quad\text{and}\quad
            \int\limits_a^b \ddt f(t) \;\mathrm{d}t = f(b) - f(a)
            \,.
        \]
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowing these two concepts are the core
to being <em>fluent</em> in the language of calculus.
It’s important to understand what \(\int\) 
means if encountered outside of math class,
and to be able to comfortably work with it in calculations.
After internalizing these core concepts, 
there is a skill that the second equation
of the fundamental theorem of calculus demands we practice.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to compute an <em>antiderivative</em> of a function.
        I.e. given a formula for a function’s derivative
        \(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}f\),
        figure out a formula for \(f\).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike the analogous skill of computing derivatives,
there is no reliable procedure to follow 
when computing antiderivatives.
Instead, honing this skill involves some creativity.
You will not master this skill in this class,
but you’ll learn a few basic tools,
and get some practice channeling that creativity.
In <a href="../../136">the next course</a>
you’ll learn more tools and further hone this skill.
</p>
<p>
The first of these basic tools is simply <em>pattern recognition</em>.
E.g. you know that the derivative of \(\tan(x)\) is \(\sec^2(x)\),
so you should recognize that you know \(\int \sec^2(x) \;\mathrm{d}x\).
The next of these tools is that the power-rule works in reverse:
\[
    \int x^n \;\mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C
    \qquad\text{for } x\neq -1\,.
\]
And then we’ll talk about the method of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">substitution</a>,
a method of undoing the chain rule.
When searching the internet for integration exercises
be sure to include the keyword <q>substitution</q>
to avoid exercises you are not ready for.
And when practicing, you can check your calculations with
<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/">Wolfram|Alpha</a>
</p>
<p>
Once this skill is developed we’ll talk about 
some applications of integration
that rely heavily on wielding that skill 
and understanding the core concepts of integration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to compute the area of any region in the coordinate plane
        bounded by the graphs of functions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Know that the volume of a
        <a title="Wikipedia: Solid of Revolution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of revolution</a>
        can be thought of as the accumulation of areas of cross-sections
        along either an axis or a radius,
        and be able to compute this volume as an integral.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Know that <em>work</em> is the accumulation of <em>force</em> applied 
        over the <em>displacement</em> of some mass,
        and be able to compute this work as an integral.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these require the understanding of an integral 
as an accumulation of something.
The first two are applications of integration to geometry,
which feels insincere as an <q>application</q>,
but provides good practice of your spatial reasoning.
The latter one though exemplifies calculus’ utility
to science as a whole.
</p>
<p>
And that’s it! 
That’s the beginning of the story of calculus.
In the sequel to this class we’ll dive deeper
into techniques of evaluating integrals,
get lost in the mysteries of \(\infty\) 
learning to find the limits of sequences and evaluate series,
and culminate the single-variable calculus adventure
by learning
