        Evaluate as many of these indefinite integrals
        as you need to feel confident with 
        the technique of substitution (change of coordinates).
        Aim to be not just familiar, but adept at this skill.
        Don’t forget your \(+C\)s!

        There is a line through the origin that divides the region 
        bounded by the parabola \(y=x-x^2\) and the \(x\)-axis 
        into two regions with equal area.

        A rocket is fired straight up, 
        burning fuel at the constant rate of \(b\) kilograms per second. 
        Let \(v = v(t)\) be the velocity of the rocket at time \(c\) 
        and suppose that the velocity \(u\) of the exhaust gas is constant. 
        Let \(M = M(t)\) be the mass of the rocket at time \(t\) 
        and note that \(M\) decreases as the fuel burns. 
        If we neglect air resistance, 
        it follows from Newton’s Second Law that
        \[ F = M\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} - ub \]
        where the force \(F = -Mg\). Thus
        \( M\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} - ub = -Mg\,.\)
        Let \(M_1\) be the mass of the rocket without fuel, 
        \(M_2\) the initial mass of the fuel, and \(M_0 = M_1 + M_2\).
        Then, until the fuel runs out at time \(t = M_2b\), 
        the mass is \(M = M_0 - bt\).
        <ol>
            <li>
            Substitute \(M = M_0 - bt\) into that last equation
            and solve the resulting equation for \(v\). 
            Use the initial condition \(v(0) = 0\) to evaluate the constant.
            </li>
            <li>
            Determine the velocity of the rocket at time \(t = M_2/b.\) 
            This is called the <em>burnout velocity</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
            First determine the height of the rocket \(y = y(t)\) at the burnout time,
            then find a formula for the height of the rocket at any time \(t\).

        In a famous 18th-century problem, known as <em>Buffon’s needle problem</em>, 
        a needle of length \(h\) is dropped onto a flat surface (e.g. a wood floor) 
        on which parallel lines \(L\) units apart, \(L \gt h\), 
        have been drawn (e.g. \(L\) is the width of a wood plank). 
        The problem is to determine the probability that the needle 
        will come to rest intersecting one of the lines. 
        Assume that the lines run east-west, parallel to the \(x\)-axis 
        in a rectangular coordinate system. 
        Let \(y\) be the distance from the “southern” end of the needle 
        to the nearest line to the north. 
        (If the needle’s southern end lies on a line, let \(y = 0\). 
        If the needle happens to lie east-west, 
        let the “western” end be the “southern” end.) 
        Let \(\theta\) be the angle that the needle makes 
        with a ray extending eastward from the “southern” end. 
        Then \(0 \leq y \leq L\) and \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\)
        Note that the needle intersects one of the lines 
        only when \(y \lt h \sin(\theta)\). 
        Now, the total set of possibilities for the needle 
        can be identified with the rectangular region
        where \(0 \leq y \leq L\) and \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\)
        and the proportion of times that the needle intersects a line is the ratio 
        \[\frac{\text{area under } y = h \sin(\theta)}{\text{area of rectangle}}\,.\]
        This ratio is the probability that the needle intersects a line. 
        Find the probability that the needle will intersect a line if \(h = L\). 
        What if \(h = L/2?\)
