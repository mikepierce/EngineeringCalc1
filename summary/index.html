<p>
    Sometimes the purpose of taking a course 
    becomes obfuscated over its duration;
    it can become hard to appreciate the plot of a story 
    when there’s too much exposition.
    This narrative overview, in its brevity, 
    serves to summarize the plot of this course
    and to clarify our purpose,
    for the sake of keeping both student and instructor 
    focused on what’s important.
</p>
<section>
<h2>Limits &amp; Continuity</h2>
<p>
    In the beginning of the story of calculus
    there are some minor characters we must meet.
    These characters’ primary importance is to 
    introduce us to the protagonists of calculus,
    differentiation and the integration,
    but we should know them in their own right first.
    The first of these minor characters 
    is the limit.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Interpret concepts of calculus including limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand what the notation
        \( \lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \) means,
        what the notation
        \( \lim_{x \to x_0^+} f(x) \) 
        and \( \lim_{x \to x_0^-} f(x) \) means,
        and what it means if \(x_0\) is replaced by \(\pm\infty.\)
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Determine limits of functions graphically, numerically, and algebraically -->
        <!-- SLO: Describe properties and behavior of functions using limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to compute
        \( \lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \),
        either numerically or precisely,
        given either a formulaic or graphical presentation of a function.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The important idea behind introducing the limit 
    is that we need language and notation
    for talking what what’s happening <em>around</em> a point \(x_0\), 
    instead of directly at the point.
    While discussing the purpose of the course,
    we’ll gradually reveal the limit’s relationship to the derivative
    and how it can help us find the slope
    of a line tangent to a curve at a given point.
</p>
<p>
    The other of minor character
    is the concept of <em>continuity</em> of a function.
    Explicitly we’ll say a function \(f\) in continuous at a point \(x_0\)
    if \(f(x_0) = \lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \),
    and continuous on a domain if it’s continuous 
    at all point in that domain.
    It’s more important though 
    to understand what continuity means conceptually.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Interpret concepts of calculus including limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand what it means for a function
        to be continuous at a point and continuous on some domain,
        and why many natural phenomenon morally
        <em>should</em> be modelled a continuous function.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can only apply the techniques of calculus
    and define the derivative and definite integral of a function 
    on some domain as a formula,
    if we take as an hypothesis that the function 
    is continuous on that domain;
    continuity is a crucial hypothesis moving forward.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Differentiation</h2>
<p>
    Since learning the language of limits
    and the idea of continuity of functions,
    we now have all we need to define the <em>derivative</em> of a function
    and will immediately discuss two important things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Interpret concepts of calculus including limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <!-- SLO: Describe properties and behavior of functions using limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Know and understand the definition of the derivative of 
        a real-valued function, 
        \[
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f(x) 
        = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\,,
        \]
        and how you can think of this derivative 
        as a rate of change of the function’s output 
        relative to the function’s input, 
        <em>or</em> how you can think of it geometrically 
        as a slope of a tangent line 
        to the graph \(y = f(x)\) of the function.
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Calculate derivatives by a variety of techniques -->
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to write a formula for the derivative of any function 
        expressed in terms of rational functions, trigonometric functions, 
        or power functions (e.g. square roots, etc).  
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The former of these is a concept you must internalize 
    as you work through exercises, reading examples, 
    and generally reading about calculus. 
    The latter is a skill you can practice until you feel proficient, 
    and luckily such exercises are plentiful online.
    Sometimes those exercises are accompanied by solutions, 
    but if they’re not a symbolic computer algebra system (CAS)
    can calculate the derivative of a function defined by a formula.
    For example, <a title="Wolfram|Alpha" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/derivative-calculator/">Wolfram|Alpha can calculate derivatives</a>.
    A word of caution though: 
    the expectation is that <em>you</em> can compute derivatives. 
    Only let a computer be your aid, not your crutch—hopefully 
    similar to the relationship you have with your calculator.
</p>
<p>
    Once you are comfortable taking derivatives of functions \(y = f(x)\) 
    where the effect the independent variable \(x\), 
    the variable you’re differentiating with respect to,
    has on a dependent variable \(y\) is made <em>explicit</em>
    you’ll need to extend this skill,
    applying it to equations where the relationship between \(x\) 
    and any independent variables is only <em>implicit</em>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Calculate derivatives by a variety of techniques -->
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to <em>implicitly differentiate</em> any equation 
        involving rational expressions, trigonometric expressions, 
        or power terms (e.g. square roots, etc)
        with respect to any variable in that equation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Just like with explicit differentiation, 
    there are plenty of exercises and worked-out examples online,
    and you can compare your computations with 
    <a title="Wolfram|Alpha implicit differentiation example" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=implicit+differentiation+for+ye%5Ex%3Dx-y">Wolfram|Alpha’s</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    In class we’ll spend time thinking about the graphs of functions,
    and what more we can say about those graphs
    given our new knowledge of derivatives.
    This isn’t an important “skill” we’re learning though.
    The purpose of doing this is to buff your 
    understanding of the geometric concept of a derivative,
    and give you a visual perspective on the relationship
    between a function and its derivative.
</p>
<p>
    There are three important uses of differentiation we’ll talk about.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Use differentiation and integration to solve application problems -->
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to apply your differentiation skills
        to analyze <em>dynamic</em> situations, 
        i.e. situations that aren’t static, that are changing over time.
        The ubiquitous class of problems 
        that require this ability to solve are called
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Related Rates" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/relatedrates.aspx">related rates problems</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Use differentiation and integration to solve application problems -->
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to apply your differentiation skills
        to optimize some quantity,
        minimize or maximize some function,
        relative to some changing parameters.
        The ubiquitous class of problems 
        that require this ability to solve are called
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Optimization" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/optimization.aspx">optimization problems</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first of these will require you 
    to be adept at implicit differentiation.
    The second will simply be an extension of a skill that
    you’ve already practiced before in math class.
    Both of these will require that you be comfortable
    synthesizing mathematical equations and relationships
    from a concrete situation.
    And luckily both of these topics are well documented on the internet;
    you way want to append the phrases <q>calculus 1</q> or <q>single variable</q>
    to your search phrases though.
</p>
<p>
    There is one last, rather fundamental, 
    numerical/computational application of differentiation we’ll discuss.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Use differentiation and integration to solve application problems -->
        <h4>Application</h4>
        <p>
        Perform <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Newton’s Method" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/newtonsmethod.aspx">Newton’s method</a> 
        to numerically approximate the solution to an equation,
        and understand generally how lines 
        can be used to approximate curves.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It’s more important that you understand the <em>idea</em>
    behind Newton’s method rather than be proficient at working it out manually;
    the goal here is <em>familiarity</em>, not <em>fluency</em>,
    so that one day you could implement it with a computer if you need to.
    If you’re practicing computer programming while taking this class though,
    you might as well implement it now.
</p>
<p>
    In the next segment of this class 
    we’ll begin to explore differentiation’s dual operation: integration.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Integration Basics</h2>
<p>
Now that we know basically everything about differentiation,
it’s time to turn our attention to the other side 
of the story of calculus: integration.
First we’ll surmount two conceptual hurdles,
understanding what integration <em>is</em>
and how it relates to differentiation.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Interpret concepts of calculus including limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <!-- SLO: Describe properties and behavior of functions using limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand that the definite integral 
        \(\int_a^b f(t) \;\mathrm{d}t\) 
        has a “physical” interpretation 
        as the total amount of <em>something</em>
        that \(f\) has accumulated 
        as its input moves from \(a\) to \(b\),
        but also a geometric interpretation as
        the signed area of the region bound by
        the graph of \(y=f(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis
        between \(a\) and \(b\).
        Furthermore understand what the function
        \(\int_0^t f\) represents.
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Interpret concepts of calculus including limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <!-- SLO: Describe properties and behavior of functions using limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Understand that a definite integral is defined 
        as the limit of a <em>Riemann sum</em> 
        as the number of summands approaches infinity.
        E.g.
        \[
            \int\limits_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
            \;\;=\;\;
            \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n} f\!\left(a + \frac{b-a}{n}i\right)
        \]
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Interpret concepts of calculus including limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <!-- SLO: Describe properties and behavior of functions using limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Have a <em>working</em> understanding of 
        the fundamental theorem of calculus,
        knowing abstractly that differentiation 
        and integration are “inverse” operations,
        and knowing concretely that
        \[
            \newcommand{\ddt}{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}}
            \ddt \int\limits_a^t f = f(t)
            \quad\text{and}\quad
            \int\limits_a^b \ddt f(t) \;\mathrm{d}t = f(b) - f(a)
            \,.
        \]
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Knowing these two concepts are the core
    to being <em>fluent</em> in the language of calculus.
    It’s important to understand what \(\int\) 
    means if encountered outside of math class,
    and to be able to comfortably work with it in calculations.
    After internalizing these core concepts, 
    there is a skill that the second equation
    of the fundamental theorem of calculus demands we practice.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate definite integrals -->
        <!-- SLO: Use basic techniques of integration to find antiderivatives -->
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to compute an <em>antiderivative</em> of a function.
        I.e. given a formula for a function’s derivative
        \(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}f\),
        figure out a formula for \(f\).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Unlike the analogous skill of computing derivatives,
    there is no reliable procedure to follow 
    when computing antiderivatives.
    Instead, honing this skill involves some creativity.
    You will not master this skill in this class,
    but you’ll learn a few basic tools,
    and get some practice channeling that creativity.
    In <a href="https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/136/">the next course</a>
    you’ll learn to further hone this skill.
</p>
<p>
    The first of these basic tools is simply <em>pattern recognition</em>.
    E.g. you know that the derivative of \(\tan(x)\) is \(\sec^2(x)\),
    so you should recognize that you know \(\int \sec^2(x) \;\mathrm{d}x\).
    The next of these tools is that the power-rule works in reverse:
    \[
        \int x^n \;\mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C
        \qquad\text{for } x\neq -1\,.
    \]
    And then we’ll talk about the method of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">substitution</a>,
    a method of undoing the chain rule.
    When searching the internet for integration exercises
    be sure to include the keyword <q>substitution</q>
    to avoid exercises you are not ready for.
    And when practicing, you can check your calculations with
    <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/">Wolfram|Alpha</a>
</p>
<p>
    Once this skill is developed we’ll talk about 
    some applications of integration
    that rely heavily on wielding that skill 
    and understanding the core concepts of integration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Use differentiation and integration to solve application problems -->
        <!-- SLO: Describe properties and behavior of functions using limits, derivatives, and integrals -->
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Be able to compute the area of any region in the coordinate plane
        bound by piece-wise differentiable curves.
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Use differentiation and integration to solve application problems -->
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Know that the volume of a
        <a title="Wikipedia: Solid of Revolution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of revolution</a>
        can be thought of as the accumulation of areas of cross-sections
        along either an axis or a radius,
        and be able to compute this volume as an integral.
    </li>
    <li>
        <!-- SLO: Use differentiation and integration to solve application problems -->
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Compute <em>work</em>, the accumulation of <em>force</em> applied 
        over the <em>displacement</em> of some mass. I.e.
        \[ \text{Work} = \int\limits_a^b \text{Force} \,\mathrm{d}x\,. \]
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each of these require the understanding of an integral 
    as an accumulation of something.
    The first two are applications of integration to geometry,
    which feels insincere as an “application”,
    but provides good practice of your spatial reasoning.
    The latter one though exemplifies calculus’ utility
    to science as a whole.
</p>
<p>
    And that’s it! 
    That’s the beginning of the story of calculus.
    In the sequel to this class we’ll 
    discuss the calculus of exponential and logarithmic functions,
    dive deeper into techniques of evaluating indefinite integrals,
    learning to calculate the sum of infinitely many numbers,
    and finally we’ll culminate the story of single-variable calculus
    by learning that 
    <a title="Wikipedia: Taylors Theorem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor's_theorem">every infinitely differentiable function can be considered as the limit of a sequence of polynomial functions</a>.
