        Calculate the following general geometric volume formulas.
        Drawing a picture of the solid being described
        will help you set up the correct integral.

            <li>
            <h4> A Sphere </h4>
                Find the volume of a sphere of radius \(1\)
                by taking the half-circular region of radius \(1\)
                that lives below the curve \(y=\sqrt{1-x^2}\)
                and rotating it about the \(x\)-axis.
                Then alter this calculation to find
                the general formula for the volume of a sphere of radius \(r\).
            </li>
            <li>
            <h4> A Cone </h4>
                Determine a formula for the volume of a right-circular cone
                (a cone with a circular base such that that
                the “point” of the cone is directly over the center of the base)
                with height \(h\) and circular base of radius \(r\).
                How would the volume change in the case
                that the “point” is not directly over the center of the base?
            </li>
            <li>
            <h4> A Square-Based Pyramid </h4>
                Determine a formula for the volume of a square-based pyramid
                with height \(h\) and with a base of side-length \(\ell\).
                How would the volume change in the case
                that the “point” is not directly over the center of the base?

        You have a bowl full of water, the shape of which
        is exactly half of a sphere of radius \(r\).
        You tilt the bowl thirty degrees, spilling out some of the water.
        What is the volume of the remaining water?

        Imagine a solid that has circular base
        with diameter \(\overline{AB}\) with length $\ell$ such that each plane
        that is perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\) intersects the solid in a square.
        Express the volume of this solid as an integral and then evaluate the integral.

        There is a line through the origin 
        that divides the region bounded by the parabola 
        \(y = x - x^2\) and the \(x\)-axis into two regions 
        with equal area. What is the slope of that line?

        A <em>clepsydra</em>, or water clock, 
        is a glass container with a small hole in the bottom 
        through which water can flow. The “clock” is calibrated 
        for measuring time by placing markings on the container
        corresponding to water levels at equally spaced times. 
        Let \(x = f(y)\) be continuous on the interval
        \([0, b]\) and assume that the container is formed 
        by rotating the graph of \(f\) about the \(y\)-axis. 
        Let \(V\) denote the volume of water and \(h\) 
        the height of the water level at time \(f\).

        <ol>
            <li>
            Determine \(V\) as a function of \(h\).
            </li>
            <li>
            Show that
            \[
            \frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t} 
            = \pi \big(f(h)\big)^2 \frac{\mathrm{d}h}{\mathrm{d}t} 
            \,.\]
            </li>
            <li>
            Suppose that \(A\) is the area of the hole 
            in the bottom of the container. 
            It follows from Torricelli’s Law that the rate of change 
            of the volume of the water is given by
            \[
            \frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t} 
            = kA \sqrt{h}
            \]
            where \(k\) is a negative constant. 
            Determine a formula for the function \(f\) 
            such that \(\mathrm{d}h/\mathrm{d}t\) is a
            constant \(C\). 
            What is the advantage in having 
            \(\mathrm{d}h/\mathrm{d}t = C\)?

        If the tangent at a point \(P\) on the curve \(y = x^3\)
        intersects the curve again at \(Q\), let \(A\) be the

        Let \(B\) be the area of the region
        defined in the same way starting with \(Q\) instead of \(P\).
