# [Engineering Calc I](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/135/)

This repo contains the HTML source of the materials for my 
for my ~16 week first-semester calculus course
designed for an class of prospective engineers.
Within each section are links to notes, video lectures, 
technology guides, demonstrations,
practice exercises, problem sets, and past midterm exams.
Chapters enumerated with § refer to
[*Calculus 9E* by Stewart](https://www.stewartcalculus.com).

### How You Might Use these Materials

  - **Harvest it for Resources** – 
If you're teaching a similar course,
there's likely overlap between the curriculum of your course and this one.
Peruse [my instance of this course](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/135/),
and look for any resources your students would appreciate.

  - **Fork/Clone it as a Template** – 
If you're teaching a sufficiently similar class soon, 
especially if you're also following the same textbook,
forking or cloning this repo as an initial template 
styling it with your own CSS, and editing it 
to fit your pacing and standards may save time.
