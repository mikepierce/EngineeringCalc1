        Consider the function \(f(x) = x(x-4)^3.\)
        Without referring on technology, 
        first verify that these are the first two derivatives of \(f.\)
        \[ f'(x) = 4(x-4)^2(x-1) \qquad \qquad f''(x)= 12(x-4)(x-2) \]
        Then answer these questions about the graph \(y = f(x)\)
        <ol>
            <li>
                What are the coordinates of the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts?
            </li>
            <li>
                On what intervals is the function increasing? Decreasing?
            </li>
            <li>
                What are the \((x,y)\) coordinates 
                of any local minimum/maximum values? 
            </li>
            <li>
                On what intervals is the graph concave up?  Concave down?
            </li>
            <li>
                Find the \((x,y)\) coordinates of any inflection points, if any exist.
            </li>
            <li>
                What are the values of the following limits?
                \[ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} f(x) \qquad \qquad \lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} f(x) \]
            </li>
            <li>
                Using everything you now know,
                accurately sketch the graph \(y = f(x)\)
            </li>

        The <em>Extreme Value Theorem</em> guarantees
        that the function \(f(x) = 5x^3-2x^2-2x\) achieves an
        absolute (global) minimum value and maximum value
        on the domain \(\left[-\frac 1 2, 1\right]\).
        Using only the aid of a basic pocket (phone) calculator,
        calculate this absolute minimum value and absolute maximum value,
        and briefly argue <em>why</em> these must be the minimum and maximum.
    </li>
    <li>
        Since sine is continuous 
        between \(\theta = 0\) and \(\theta = \frac \pi 2,\)
        by the <em>Intermediate Value Theorem</em>
        there must be some number \(c\) between \(0\) and \(\frac \pi 2\)
        such that the output \(\sin(c)\) is equal to
        the average value of sine on that interval.
        Find the average value of sine between
        \(\theta = 0\) and \(\theta = \frac \pi 2\),
        and find such a number \(c\).
