        The function \(A\) with formula \( A(r) = \pi r^2\)
        returns the area of a circle given its radius.
        What is a formula for the derivative 
        \(\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}r}?\)
        This formula should look familiar.
        Is there a reason for this,
        or is it just a coincidence?
    </li>
    <li>
        The function \(V\) with formula \( V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\)
        returns the volume of a sphere given its radius.
        What is a formula for the derivative
        \(\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}r}?\)
        Based on the familiar formula for \(A'\)
        that appeared in the previous question,
        speculate what \(V'\) could be a formula for.

        Consider a sphere with radius increasing 
        at a constant rate of 2in/min (imagine a balloon).
        At what rate is the volume of the sphere increasing
        the moment that the radius is 3in?

        Consider a sphere with volume increasing 
        at a constant rate of 5in³/min.
        At what rate is the radius of the sphere increasing
        the moment that the volume is 7in³?

        A magic cube of jello, 3 mm on each side,
        is beginning to grow before your eyes.
        If a side-length of the cube is growing
        at a constant rate of 7 mm/s, 
        at what rate is the volume changing
        the moment a side is 5 mm long?

        Two cars are sitting next to each other in the desert,
        one pointing north and the other pointing east.
        At the same moment, they each take off 
        in the direction they're pointed,
        the first car at 50 mph and the second car at 32 mph.
        At what rate is the distance between them increasing
        ½ hour after they take off?

        Given a triangle with side-lengths \(A\) and \(B\)
        with angle \(\theta\) between those sides, 
        the formula \(\frac{1}{2}AB\sin(\theta)\) 
        gives the area of the triangle.

            <li>
                Suppose \(A = 5\) ft and \(B = 2\) ft
                and the angle \(\theta\) is opening (increasing)
                at a rate of \(\frac{1}{4}\) radian-per-second.
                How fast is the area changing the moment 
                the angle is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}?\)

                at a rate of 1 ft²/s.

                Suppose now that \(A = 5\) ft, 
                but that \(B\) is increasing at a rate of \(3\) ft/s
                while \(\theta\) is increasing at a rate 
                of \(\frac{1}{4}\) radian-per-second.
                At a certain moment in time, 
                \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) and \(B = 8.\)
                At what rate is the area changing at this moment?

        Recall the <em>law of cosines</em>
        \[C^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB\cos(\theta)\]
        that relates the lengths of any side of a triangle \(C\)
        to the other two sides \(A\) and \(B\) 
        and the angle \(\theta\) opposite it.
