        <p>
        For any positive number \(N,\)
        here is a simple method for approximating 
        the square root of \(N.\)
        Start by guessing/estimating 
        some positive integer \(x\) near \(\sqrt{N}.\)
        Plugging \(x\) into the formula
        \[x_\star = \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{N}{x}\right)\]
        will result in a number \(x_\star\) 
        that is closer to \(\sqrt{N}\) than \(x.\)
        In fact, plugging <em>any</em> input into this formula
        will return a number closer to \(\sqrt{N}\) than the input.
        Furthermore, the successive outputs that result
        from recursively applying this formula, 
        plugging each output back in as the next input,
        will approach the exact value of \(\sqrt{N}.\)
        </p>
        <p>
        This procedure is commonly called 
        the <em>Babylonian method</em> for computing square roots 
        since it was known to Babylonian mathematicians millennia ago.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Show that this formula 
                is the same as the “next guess” formula
                that results from applying Newton’s method
                to approximate a solution of the equation \(x^2-N=0,\)
                hence justifying why the Babylonian method 
                of approximating \(\sqrt{N}\) works.
            </li>
            <li class="hard">
                Write a computer program 
                that iteratively applies this formula 
                to calculate the square root of a number. 
                (Note: the TI-83/84+ series of calculators are programmable.)
            </li>
            <li class="hard">
                Using this formula, 
                write a recursive computer program 
                that calculates the square root
                of a number accurate to the precision
                of the language’s <code>float</code> data type.
            </li>
            <li>
                Come up with similar recursive formulas
                for the following operations:
                \[
                    \sqrt[3]{x}
                    \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
                    \frac{1}{x}
                \]
                <aside>
                    It can be tough to figure out
                    the one for \(\frac{1}{x}\).
                    The formula (procedure) you get for it though, called 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Newton%E2%80%93Raphson_division">Newton-Raphson division</a>,
                    is rather noteworthy.

        The equation \(\cos(x) = x\) has a single solution.
        We call it the
        <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DottieNumber.html">Dottie Number</a>.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Demonstrate <em>Newton’s method</em>
                by calculating the Dottie number
                accurate to eight decimal places.
            </li>
            <li class="hard">
                Write a program that performs Newton’s Method,
                and use that program to calculate the Dottie number
                accurate to the precision of the language’s <code>float</code> data type.
                Note the TI-83/84+ series of calculators are programmable.
                Can your program calculate \(x\)
                to arbitrary precision?
            </li>
            <li class="hard">
                Put your calculator in <code>radians</code> mode.
                Take the cosine of <em>any</em> number.
                Then take the cosine of that result.
                And then take the cosine of that result.
                And then take the cosine of that result.
                Keep doing this for awhile,
                and you should notice that this process
                converges to that same solution to \(\cos(x) = x\).
                Assuming this does converge,
                why must it converge to this same number?

        In general, there is no explicit formula
        for the roots of polynomial of degree higher than four.
        However we can use Newton’s method 
        to approximate the roots of any polynomial.
        Approximate the value of the single real root
        of this polynomial using Newton’s method.
        \[x^5 + 2x^4 + 3x^3 + 4x^2 + 5x +6\]
    </li>
    <li>
        The polynomial \(x^3-x\) has three roots: 
        \(-1\) and \(0\) and \(1.\)
        Determine the set of all real numbers \(x\) 
        such that Newton’s method will converge to \(1\)
        upon being initiated with guess \(x\).
    </li>
    <li>
        The arctangent function has a single root at zero.
        But, depending on the initial guess, 
        Newton’s method might fail to hone in on this root,
        and will instead return numbers further and further away from zero.
        Graph the function \(y = \arctan(x)\) and,
        based on the geometry of the graph,
        figure out for which initial guesses 
        Newton’s method will converge to zero,
        and for which initial guesses Newton’s method will diverge.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes Newton’s method fails to converge,
        but <em>not</em> because the successive approximations
        blow up towards infinity.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Consider the polynomial \(x^3-2x+2.\)
                This polynomial has a root at \(x \approx -1.7693.\)
                However, applying Newton’s method, 
                if we start with the initial guess at zero,
                the method will not converge to the root.
                Investigate why Newton’s method fails in this case.
                Are there any other initial guesses for which
                Newton’s method will fail to converge to the root?
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, investigate \(x^5-x-1\)
                with an initial guess of zero.

                To ascribe vocabulary to the phenomenon 
                that the previous prompts demonstrate,
                certain initial guesses \(x_0\) may not 
                lead to a sequence \(x_1, x_2, \dotsc\)
                that converges to the root of the function,
                but instead enter an <em>orbit</em>.
                The polynomial \(x^3-2x+2\)
                with initial guess \(x_0=0\) 
                induces a \(2\)-orbit,
                The polynomial \(x^5-x-1\) 
                with initial guess \(x_0=0\) 
                induces and \(3\)-orbit.
                </p>
                <p>
                Given a positive integer \(n\)
                find an example of a polynomial 
                that will induce an \(n\)-orbit
                for an initial guess of zero.
