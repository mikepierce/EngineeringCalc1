<h2>Overview of Differentiation</h2>
<p>
Since learning the language of limits
and the idea of continuity of functions,
we now have all we need to define the <em>derivative</em> of a function
and will immediately discuss two important things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Know and understand the definition of the derivative of a function, 
        \[
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f(x) 
        = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\,,
        \]
        and how you can think of this derivative 
        as a rate of change of the function output 
        relative to the function input, 
        <em>or</em> how you can think of it geometrically 
        as a slope of a tangent line.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to write a formula for the derivative of any function 
        expressed in terms of rational functions, trigonometric functions, 
        or power functions (e.g. square roots, etc).  
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
The former of these is a concept you must internalize 
as you work through exercises, reading examples, 
and generally reading about calculus. 
(You do read, right? If not the textbook, 
then any helpful notes or pages online.)
The latter is a skill you can practice until you feel proficient, 
and luckily 
<a title="Google Image search of derivative exercises" href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=derivative%20exercises&tbs=imgo:1">such exercises are plentiful online</a>. 
Sometimes those exercises are accompanied by solutions, 
but if they’re not
<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/derivative-calculator/">Wolfram|Alpha can compute derivatives for you</a>.
A word of caution though: 
the expectation is that <em>you</em> can compute derivatives. 
Let Wolfram|Alpha be your aid, not your crutch—hopefully 
similar to the relationship you have with your calculator.

<p>
Once you are comfortable taking derivatives of functions \(y = f(x)\) 
where the effect the independent variable \(x\), 
the variable you’re differentiating with respect to,
has on a dependent variable \(y\) is made <q>explicit</q>
you’ll need to extend this skill,
applying it to equations where the relationship between \(x\) 
and any independent variables is only <q>implicit</q>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to implicitly differentiate any equation 
        involving rational expressions, trigonometric expressions, 
        or power terms (e.g. square roots, etc).  
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Just like with explicit differentiation, 
there are plenty of exercises and worked-out examples online,
and you can compare your computations with 
<a title="Wolfram|Alpha implicit differentiation example" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=implicit+differentiation+for+ye%5Ex%3Dx-y">Wolfram|Alpha’s</a>.

In class we’ll spend time thinking about the graphs of functions,
and what more we can say about those graphs
given our new knowledge of derivatives.
This isn’t an important skill we’re learning though.
The purpose of doing this is to buff your 
understanding of the concept of a derivative,
and give you a visual perspective on the relationship
between a function and its derivative.
</p>
<p>
Beyond this, there are three important 
uses of differentiation we’ll talk about.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Be able to apply your differentiation skills
        to analyze <em>dynamic</em> situations, 
        i.e. situations that aren’t static, that are changing over time.
        The ubiquitous class of problems 
        that require this ability to solve are called
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Related Rates" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/relatedrates.aspx">related rates problems</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Be able to apply your differentiation skills
        to optimize some quantity,
        minimize or maximize some function,
        relative to some changing parameters.
        The ubiquitous class of problems 
        that require this ability to solve are called
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Optimization" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/optimization.aspx">optimization problems</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first of these will require you 
to be adept at implicit differentiation.
The second will simply be an extension of a skill that (I hope!) 
you’ve already practiced before in math class.
Both of these will require that you be comfortable
synthesizing mathematical equations and relationships
from a concrete situation.
And luckily both of these topics are well documented on the internet;
you way want to append the phrases <q>calculus 1</q> or <q>single variable</q>
to your search phrases though.
</p>
<p>
There is one last numerical/computational application
of differentiation we’ll discuss.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Perform
        <a title="Paul’s Online Notes: Newton’s Method" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/newtonsmethod.aspx">Newton’s method</a> 
        manually, and understand that lines are very useful.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
It’s more important that you understand the <em>idea</em>
behind Newton’s method rather than be proficient at working it out manually;
the goal here is <em>familiarity</em>, not <em>fluency</em>,
so that one day you could implement it with a computer if you need to.
If you’re practicing computer programming while taking this class though,
you might as well implement it now.
</p>
<p>
In the next segment of class we’ll explore 
differentiation’s dual operation: integration.
