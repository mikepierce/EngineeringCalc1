    <li style="padding-bottom:12em;">
        A drag race, commonly called a <em>pass</em>, 
        is run on a 1320ft (¼ mile) long track. 
        Suppose a dragster finishes a pass in ten seconds. 
        How fast was the dragster going?
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom:12em;">
        Suppose we know that this same dragster 
        travelled 285ft in the first five seconds of the pass. 
        What was its average speed of the dragster 
        for the first half of the race? 
        What was its average speed of the dragster 
        for the second half of the race?  
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom:12em;">
        Suppose we have a model for how far \(d\) the dragster has travelled
        from the starting line for any time \(t\)
        between zero and ten seconds after it started the pass,
        and that model for the distance is given by a function \(f\) of time as
        \[ d \;=\; f(t) = t^3 + 32t\,. \]
        How fast was the dragster going <em>exactly</em>
        five seconds into the pass?
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom:12em;">
        Suppose a dragster starts a 1320ft pass 
        at a constant speed of 6ft/s. 
        After five seconds the dragster enters a wormhole 
        and is instantly transported to a position 30ft from the finish line, 
        from where it continues at a constant speed of 6ft/s,
        finishing the pass in ten seconds. 
        What was the average speed of the dragster during this pass?

<h2>The Full Prompt</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom:12em;">
    A drag race, commonly called a <em>pass</em>, 
    is run on a \(1320\) ft (¼ mile) long track. 
    Suppose we have a model for how far \(d\) the dragster has travelled
    from the starting line for any time \(t\) after it started the pass
    until \({t=10}\) seconds when it crossed the finish line,
    and that model for the distance is given by a function \(f\) of time as
    \[ d \;=\; f(t) = t^3 + 32t\,. \]
    How fast was the dragster going <em>exactly</em>
    five seconds into the pass?
