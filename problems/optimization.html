        We want to construct a box whose base length is three times the base width. 
        The material used to build the top and bottom cost $10/ft² 
        and the material used to build the sides cost $6/ft². 
        If the box must have a volume of \(50\)ft³ 
        determine the dimensions that will minimize the cost to build the box.

        A manufacturer needs to make a cylindrical can 
        that will hold \(12 \mathrm{fl oz}\) of cream soda.
        Determine the dimensions of the can that will
        minimize the amount of material used in its construction.
        (Recall that for food products in the US,
        \(1 \mathrm{fl oz} \approx 30 \mathrm{ml}\), 
        which as a volume corresponds to 30 \mathrm{cm}^3\)).

        Over a time period of five years, it is shown that the number
        \(N\) of independently owned bakeries is given by
        \[ N(t)=2+8.82t-7.73t^2+2.08t^3-0.175t^4 \ \ \ 0\leq t \leq 5 \]

        A <em>Norman window</em> has a shape 
        of a rectangle surmounted by a semicircle —
        it has three straight sides and one curved side on top,
        and the diameter of the semi-circular curved side
        is equal to the width of the rectangle.

        Suppose we are planning to make a taco 
        from a round tortilla with diameter 8 inches 
        by bending the tortilla so that it is shaped 
        as if it is partially wrapped around a circular cylinder. 
        e will fill the tortilla to the edge (but no more) 
        with meat, cheese, and other ingredients. 
        Our problem is to decide how to curve the tortilla 
        in order to maximize the volume of food it can hold.

                along a diameter of the tortilla 
                and folding the tortilla around the cylinder. 
                Let \(x\) represent the distance from the center 
                of the tortilla to a point \(P\) on the diameter. 
                Show that the cross-sectional area of the filled taco 
                in the plane through \(P\) perpendicular to the axis 
                of the cylinder is
                \[ A(x) = r\sqrt{16-x^2} - \frac{1}{2}r^2\sin\!\left(\frac{2}{r}\sqrt{16-x^2}\right)\,. \]
                Write an expression for the volume of the filled taco.
