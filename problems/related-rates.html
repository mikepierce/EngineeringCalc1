        For these implicitly defined functions \(y = f(x)\),
        solve for \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\)

            x + y + xy + y^2 + x^2 = 5

        Verify that the point \((1,2)\) lies on the curve,
        then find an equation of the line 
        tangent to the curve at that point.

        A ladder \(15\) ft long rests against a vertical wall. 
        Its top slides down the wall while its bottom 
        moves away along the level ground at a speed of \(2\)ft/s.

        A boat is pulled into a dock by means of a rope 
        attached to a pulley on the dock. 
        The rope is attached to the bow of the boat 
        at a point \(1\)m below the pulley. 
        If the rope is pulled through the pulley at a rate of \(1\)m/sec,
        at what rate will the boat be approaching the dock 
        when \(10\)m of rope is out.

        A police cruiser is chasing a speeding car. 
        The cruiser is headed south towards an intersection.
        The speeding car has already passed the intersection, heading east. 
        When the police cruiser is 0.6 mi north of the intersection, 
        the car is 0.8 mi to the east, 
        and the police radar determines that 
        the distance between them and the car is increasing at 20mph. 
        If the cruiser is moving at 60mph when this measurement is made, 
        what is the speed of the car?

        An oil well located near the middle of a calm, shallow lake 
        is leaking oil onto the surface of the lake 
        at the rate of 16 cubic feet per minute. 
        Since oil and water don’t mix, as the oil leaks onto the surface of the lake 
        it spreads out into a uniform layer, called an oil slick, 
        that floats on top of the water. 
        The slick is circular, centered at the leak, and 0.02 ft thick. 
        Find the rate at which the radius of the slick is increasing 
        when the radius is 500, and when the radius is 700 ft. 
        Why would you expect the rates of change of the radii to be different, 
        even though the oil is being added at a constant rate?

        A plane is flying at \(500\)mph at an altitude of 3 miles in a direction away from you
        (i.e. the point on the ground directly beneath

        you increasing at the moment when the plane is flying over a point on the

        A swing consists of a board at the end of a \(10\) ft long rope.  Think of the
        board as a point \(P\) at the end of the rope, and let \(Q\) be the point of
        attachment at the other end.  Suppose that the swing is directly below \(Q\)
        at time \(t=0\) and is being pushed by someone who walks at the speed of \(6\)
        ft/sec from left to right.  Find (a) how fast the swing is rising after \(1\)
        sec; (b) the angular speed of the rope in deg/sec after \(1\) sec.

        which the pressure increases when \(V = 10\) and \(p= 5\).

        as a four dimensional sphere which expands in space
        time. Assume the volume \(V = \frac 1 2 \pi^2 r^2\) increases at a
        rate \(\dot V = 100\pi^2r^2\), What is \(\dot r\)?

        A water tank has the shape of a horizontal cylinder with radius \(1\) and length \(2\).
