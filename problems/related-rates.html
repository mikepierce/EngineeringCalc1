        A 15 ft long ladder rests against a vertical wall. 
        Its top begins sliding down the wall at a speed of 2 ft/s,
        while its base begins sliding along the ground away from the wall.
        How fast is the angle between the <em>top</em> of the ladder 
        and the wall changing at the moment the angle is π/3 radians?

        A boat is pulled into a dock by means of a rope 
        attached to a crank on the dock. 
        The rope is tethered to a cleat on the bow of the boat 
        that is one meter below the pulley. 
        If the rope is reeled into the crank at a rate of one m/s,
        at what rate will the boat be approaching the dock 
        the moment there only ten meters of rope out?

        A police cruiser is chasing a speeding car. 
        The cruiser is headed south towards an intersection.
        The speeding car has already passed through the intersection, turning left towards the east. 
        When the police cruiser is still 0.6 miles north of the intersection, 
        the car is 0.8 miles to the east of it, 
        and the police radar determines that 
        the distance between their cruiser and the car is increasing at 20 mph. 
        If the cruiser is cruising at 60 mph when this measurement is made, 
        what is the speed of the car?

        An oil well located near the middle of a calm, shallow lake 
        is leaking oil onto the surface of the lake 
        at the rate of 16 ft³ per minute. 
        Since oil and water don’t mix, as the oil leaks onto the surface of the lake 
        it spreads out into a uniform layer, called an oil slick, 
        that floats on top of the water. 
        The slick is circular, centered at the leak, and 0.02 ft thick. 
        Find the rate at which the radius of the slick is increasing 
        when the radius is 500 ft, and again when the radius is 700 ft. 
        Why would you expect the rates of change of the radii to be different, 
        even though the oil is being added at a constant rate?

        A swing consists of a board at the end of a 10 ft long rope.
        Think of the board as a point \(P\) at the end of the rope,
        and let \(Q\) be the point of attachment at the other end.
        Suppose that the swing is directly below \(Q\) at time \(t=0\) 
        and is being pushed by someone who walks at the speed of 6 ft/s from left to right.
        Find (a) the speed the swing is rising after one second
        and (b) the angular speed of the rope in radians-per-second after one second.

        Little Cindy-Sue is about to lose her first tooth. 
        Her dad, knowing no better, decides to employ the age-old tooth-extraction technique
        of tying one end of a piece of string to the tooth, the other end to a doorknob,
        and then slamming the door shut.
        He gets a \(4'\) piece of string and ties it to a doorknob that is \(3'\)
        away from the hinges of the door.
        Opening the door to a right-angle, flush with the wall,
        he places Cindy-Sue along the same wall \(3.228'\) away from the doorknob,
        and ties the other end of the string to her tooth. 
        Luckily, Cindy-Sue's tooth is exactly as high off the ground as the doorknob.
        Excited now, he swings the door, slamming it from against the wall to fully closed
        (at a constant angular speed) in \(1/8\) of a second, successfully pulling the tooth!
        At what velocity was the distance between Cindy-Sue's tooth and the doorknob increasing
        at the moment the string become taught and the tooth yanked out?
        <!-- Answer should be ≈36ft/s if I worked it out right. -->
