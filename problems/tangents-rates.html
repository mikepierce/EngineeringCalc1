    Note that some of the prompts on this page 
    don’t ask for an <em>exact</em> (true) answer,
    but instead an <em>approximation</em>.
    Try to keep your approximations accurate 
    to within \(10^{-3}\) of the true answer.

        First, briskly sketch a plot of this data
        with your independent variable \(x\) 
        measured in hours since 6am.
        <ol>
            <li>
                On average, how many steps per hour
                did the person take today?
            </li>
            <li>
                On average, how many steps per hour
                did the person take in the morning?
                On average, how many steps per hour
                did the person take in the afternoon?
            </li>
            <li>
                In your plot, what is the slope 
                of the secant line between the points
                corresponding to 8am and 3pm?
                What is the meaning of this slope in context?
            </li>
            <li>
                If this person asked you to look at this data
                and to determine you how fast they were walking (steps/hr)
                at <em>exactly</em> 5pm, how would you estimate this?
                Note: we can’t <em>know</em> this only from this data,
                so your task is only to make an informed estimation.
            </li>
        </ol>

        A particle moves back and forth along a straight line.
        After designating a point along its path as the origin,
        you begin observing the particle at time \(t=0\) and surmise
        that the distance, in miles, the particle is from the origin 
        is given by the function
        \[f(t) = \cos\left(t^2-3t+1\right) \,.\]
        Note: the cosine function expects an argument in radian measure.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Approximately, 
                what is the average velocity of the particle
                between \(t=0\) and \(t=1?\)
                What about between \(t=0\) and \(t=0.5?\)
                What about between \(t=0\) and \(t=0.1?\)
                What about between \(t=0\) and \(t=0.01?\)
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue what you were doing in the previous part
                to approximate the speed of the particle
                the moment you began observing it.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Approximately what is the slope of the line 
        tangent to the curve \(y = \sqrt{x}\tan(x)\) at \(x=3\)?
    </li>
    <li>
        A child on the roof of the Empire State Building 
        hurls a penny towards the city streets below. 
        The height of the penny after \(t\) seconds,
        willfully ignoring air resistance,
        can be fairly accurately modelled by the function
        \[f(t) = 1250 - 42t - 5t^2\,.\]
        <ol>
            <li>
                According to this model, 
                approximately how long before the penny hits the ground?
            </li>
            <li>
                According to this model, 
                approximately what is the speed of the penny 
                when it hits the ground?
            </li>
        </ol>

        Suppose we have a model for how far \(d\) 
        a dragster has travelled from the starting line 
        for any time \(t\) between zero and ten seconds 
        after it started a pass, and that model for the distance 
        is given by a function \(f\) of time as
        \[ d \;=\; f(t) = t^3 + 32t\,. \]
        <ol>
            <li>
                Approximately how fast was the dragster going 
                at the \(t=10\) seconds mark, 
                the moment it crossed the finish line?
            </li>
            <li class="hard">
                The average velocity of the dragster 
                for the entire pass was 132ft/s.
                Conceivably, since the dragster starts out at 0ft/s
                and ends the pass going much faster than 132ft/s,
                at some time <em>during</em> the pass
                it was going exactly 132ft/s.
                Can you estimate at what time during the pass
                the dragster’s velocity was 132ft/s?
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> 
        What’s an equation for the line 
        tangent to the graph \(y= f(x)\)
        of the function \(f(x) = \sqrt{3x^2-8}+2\)
        at the point \((2,f(2))?\)
