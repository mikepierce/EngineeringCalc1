        Suppose a police cruiser is chasing a speeding car. The police cruiser is heading south approaching an intersection, and the speeding car has already passed the intersection and is heading east. When the police cruiser is 0.6 mi north of the intersection, the car is 0.8 mi to the east, and the police radar determines that the distance between them and the car is increasing at 20mph. If the cruiser is moving at 60mph when this measurement is made, what is the speed of the car?

        An oil well located near the middle of a calm, shallow lake is leaking oil onto the surface of the lake at the rate of 16 cubic feet per minute. Since oil and water don't mix, as the oil leaks onto the surface of the lake it spreads out into a uniform layer, called an oil slick, that floats on top of the water. The slick is circular, centered at the leak, and 0.02 ft thick. Find the rate at which the radius of the slick is increasing when the radius is 500 and 700 ft. Why would you expect the rates of change of the radii to be different, even though the oil is being added at a constant rate?

        A plane is flying at 500 mph at an altitude of 3 miles in a direction away
        from where you're standing (i.e., the point on the ground directly beneath
        the plane is moving away from you).  How fast is the plane's distance from
        you increasing at the moment when the plane is flying over a point on the
        ground 4 miles from you?

        You are inflating a spherical balloon at the rate of seven cm³/sec.  How
        fast is its radius increasing at the instant when the radius is four centimeters? 
        How fast is the area increasing at the same time?

        Water is poured into a conical container at the rate of \(10\) cm³/sec.
        The cone points directly down (see side view at right), and it has a height
        of \(30\) cm and a base radius of \(10\) cm.  How fast is the water level rising
        when the water is \(4\) cm deep (at its deepest point)?

        A swing consists of a board at the end of a \(10\) ft long rope.  Think of the
        board as a point \(P\) at the end of the rope, and let \(Q\) be the point of
        attachment at the other end.  Suppose that the swing is directly below \(Q\)
        at time \(t=0\) and is being pushed by someone who walks at the speed of \(6\)
        ft/sec from left to right.  Find (a) how fast the swing is rising after \(1\)
        sec; (b) the angular speed of the rope in deg/sec after \(1\) sec.

The ideal gas law \(pV = T\) relates pressure \(p\) and 
volume \(V\) and temperature \(T\). Assume the temperature
\(T = 50\) is fixed and \(\dot V=—5\). Find the rate \(\dot p\) with
which the pressure increases when \(V = 10\) and \(p= 5\).

There are cosmological models which see our universe
as a four dimensional sphere which expands in space
time. Assume the volume \(V = \frac 1 2 \pi^2 r^2\) increases at a
rate \(\dot V = 100\pi^2r^2\), What is \(\dot r\)? 
Evaluate it for \(r = 47\) (billion light years).

A water tank has the shape of a horizontal cylinder with radius \(1\) and length \(2\).
If water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of \(\frac 1 6\) m³ per minute, find the
rate at which the water level is rising when the water is \(\frac 1 2\)  m deep.
