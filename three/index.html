<h2>Overview of Integration Basics</h2>
<p>
Now that we know basically everything about differentiation,
it’s time to turn our attention to the other side 
of the story of calculus: integration.
First we’ll surmount two conceptual hurdles,
understanding what integration <em>is</em>
and how it relates to differentiation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Concept</h4>
    Understand that the definite integral 
    \(\int_a^b f(t) \;\mathrm{d}t\) 
    has a <q>physical</q> interpretation 
    as the total amount of <em>something</em>
    that \(f\) has accumulated 
    as its input moves from \(a\) to \(b\),
    but also a geometric interpretation as
    the signed area of the region bound by
    the graph of \(y=f(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis
    between \(a\) and \(b\).
    Furthermore understand what the function
    \(\int_0^t f\) represents.
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Concept</h4>
    Have a <em>working</em> understanding of 
    the fundamental theorem of calculus,
    knowing abstractly that differentiation 
    and integration are <q>inverse</q> operations,
    and knowing concretely that
    \[
        \newcommand{\ddt}{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}}
        \ddt \int\limits_a^t f = f(t)
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \int\limits_a^b \ddt f(t) \;\mathrm{d}t = f(b) - f(a)
        \,.
    \]
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowing these two concepts are the core
to being <em>fluent</em> in the language of calculus.
It’s important to understand what \(\int\) 
means if encountered outside of math class,
and to be able to comfortably work with it in calculations.
After internalizing these core concepts, 
there is a skill that the second equation
of the fundamental theorem of calculus demands we practice.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Skill</h4>
    Be able to compute an <em>antiderivative</em> of a function.
    I.e. given a formula for a function’s derivative
    \(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}f\),
    figure out a formula for \(f\).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike the analogous skill of computing derivatives,
there is no reliable procedure to follow 
when computing antiderivatives.
Instead, honing this skill involves some creativity.
You will not master this skill in this class,
but you’ll learn a few basic tools,
and get some practice channeling that creativity.
In <a href="../../136">the next course</a>
you’ll learn more tools and further hone this skill.
</p>
<p>
The first of these basic tools is simply <em>pattern recognition</em>.
E.g. you know that the derivative of \(\tan(x)\) is \(\sec^2(x)\),
so you should recognize that you know \(\int \sec^2(x) \;\mathrm{d}x\).
The next of these tools is that the power-rule works in reverse:
\[
    \int x^n \;\mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} + C
    \qquad\text{for } x\neq -1\,.
\]
And then we’ll talk about the method of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">substitution</a>,
a method of undoing the chain rule.
When searching the internet for integration exercises
be sure to include the keyword <q>substitution</q>
to avoid exercises you are not ready for.
And when practicing, you can check your calculations with
<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/">Wolfram|Alpha</a>
</p>
<p>
Once this skill is developed we’ll talk about 
some applications of integration
that rely heavily on wielding that skill 
and understanding the core concepts of integration.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Application</h4>
    Be able to compute the area of any region in the coordinate plane
    bounded by the graphs of functions.
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Application</h4>
    Know that the volume of a
    <a title="Wikipedia: Solid of Revolution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of revolution</a>
    can be thought of as the accumulation of areas of cross-sections
    along either an axis or a radius,
    and be able to compute this volume as an integral.
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Application</h4>
    Know that <em>work</em> is the accumulation of <em>force</em> applied 
    over the <em>displacement</em> of some mass,
    and be able to compute this work as an integral.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these require the understanding of an integral 
as an accumulation of something.
The first two are applications of integration to geometry,
which feels insincere as an <q>application</q>,
but provides good practice of your spatial reasoning.
The latter one though exemplifies calculus’ utility
to science as a whole.
</p>
<p>
And that’s it! 
That’s the beginning of the story of calculus.
In the sequel to this class we’ll dive deeper
into techniques of evaluating integrals,
get lost in the mysteries of \(\infty\) 
learning to find the limits of sequences and evaluate series,
and culminate the single-variable calculus adventure
by learning
